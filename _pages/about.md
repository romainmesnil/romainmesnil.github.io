Welcome to my website!

About me
======
I am a researcher in structural design and construction automation at  [Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées](https://ecoledesponts.fr). I am leading [Build'in](https://buildin-enpc.fr) a research team on robotic manufacturing for construction, and I am an associated researcher of [Laboratoire Navier](https://navier-lab.fr/) in the _Matériaux et Structures Architecturés_ team.

Research interest
======
I am striving to find better ways to design and construct more efficient and sustainable building structures. My research encompasses several fields, from structural morphology, structural optimization, digital manufacturing. In the past years, I have been involved in the supervision of several Ph.D's on 3D concrete printing, with a special focus on process engineering, and structural applications of this technology.
