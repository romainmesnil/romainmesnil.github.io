Welcome to my website!

About me
======
I am a researcher in structural design and construction automation at  [Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées](https://ecoledesponts.fr). I am leading [Build'in](https://buildin-enpc.fr) a research team on robotic manufacturing for construction, and I am an associated researcher of [Laboratoire Navier](https://navier-lab.fr/) in the _Matériaux et Structures Architecturés_ team and associate professor at Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées.

Research interest
======
I am striving to find better ways to design and construct more efficient and sustainable building structures. My research encompasses several fields, from structural morphology, structural optimization, digital manufacturing. My first interest was architectural geometry and applications of discrete differential geometry to the rationalization of construction of curved building structures and envelopes. More recently, I have been involved in the supervision of several Ph.D's on 3D concrete printing, with a special focus on process engineering, and structural applications of this technology.

Teaching
======
I was in charge of the teaching modules _Architectural Geometry I &II_ at _Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées_ from 2016 to 2024, in the framework of _Digital Building Design_, a postgraduate program devoted to computational design for architecture.

I regularly coordinate or take part in collaborative design and build workshop with Prof. Cyril Douthe and Prof. Olivier Baverel. Some of our teaching experiments can be found on [Thinkshell](https://thinkshell.fr/workshop/), a project that we developed conjointly with Lionel du Peloux.
